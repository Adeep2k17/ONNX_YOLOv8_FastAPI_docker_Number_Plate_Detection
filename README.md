# ONNX-YOLOv8-FastAPI-Vehicle-Number-Plate-Detection
Vehicle Number Plate Detection using onnx YOLOv8 trained on custom dataset and deployed using FastAPI with docker container

## Introduction
In the ever-evolving landscape of computer vision and machine learning, two powerful technologies have emerged as key players in their respective domains: YOLO (You Only Look Once) and FastAPI. YOLO has gained fame for its real-time object detection capabilities, while FastAPI has earned a reputation as one of the most efficient and user-friendly web frameworks for building APIs. In this project, we'll explore the exciting synergy that can be achieved by hosting YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art YOLO variant, using Onnxruntime with FastAPI.
